# Home Service Robot
## Objective
This is the final project of **_Udacity Robotics Software Engineer_** Nano Degree Program which applies SLAM and Navigation on mobile robot. The goal of this project was to design a robot's environment in gazebo and program the home-service robot that will map it's environment and autonomously navigate to pre-specified pickup and drop-off locations(_Performing Delivery_). For this one needed to:
-Design robot's environment with the Building Editor in Gazebo.
-Teleoperate the robot and manually test SLAM.

-Write a pick_objects node that commands the robot to move to the desired pickup and drop off zones.
-Write an add_markers node that subscribes to the robot odometry and publishes pick-up and drop-off markers to rviz.
-modify pick_objects node and add_markers node to establish communication between them, to complete desired home service robot implementation
